### 1. Microwave-Assisted Water Purification / Disinfection
**Domain:** Environmental Science / Microbiology
**Problem:**
Billions of people lack clean drinking water. Boiling works but uses a lot of fuel.
Microwave radiation (2.45 GHz) heats water but ALSO has direct electromagnetic
effects on bacterial cell membranes that may destroy pathogens at temperatures
BELOW boiling point (potentially 60-70°C instead of 100°C), saving significant energy.
**Challenge:**
Determine the optimal microwave power level, exposure time, and water volume to
achieve >99% pathogen kill at the LOWEST possible temperature. Is there a
frequency-dependent resonance effect on bacterial membranes that causes
disruption before thermal death? If so, a cheap modified microwave emitter
could purify water using far less energy than boiling.
**Home Test:** Microwave water samples at different power/time combos. Compare
bacterial survival (simple methylene blue or yeast viability tests) between
microwave-heated vs. stove-heated water at the same temperature.

### 2. Copper's Antimicrobial Surface Enhancement via Thermal Cycling
**Domain:** Materials Science / Public Health
**Problem:**
Copper surfaces kill bacteria within hours (the "oligodynamic effect"), but the
mechanism slows as copper oxide forms. Hospitals can't afford to constantly polish
copper surfaces. Could a simple thermal cycling process (heating and cooling
copper) create a specific surface micro-texture or oxide pattern that ACCELERATES
antimicrobial action instead of hindering it?
**Challenge:**
Find the optimal heating temperature (oven: 150-250°C) and cooling rate (air vs.
water quench) for copper sheets that maximizes antimicrobial surface area and
maintains a self-renewing oxide layer. The result would be a free, DIY protocol
for making "super-antimicrobial" copper door handles, surfaces, and water vessels
for communities without access to healthcare.
**Home Test:** Heat copper sheets/pipes in oven at different temps, cool differently.
Test antimicrobial performance by placing bread/fruit on treated vs untreated copper.

### 3. Thermoelectric Power from Waste Heat (Heater/Stove Gradient)
**Domain:** Energy Physics / Thermodynamics
**Problem:**
Enormous amounts of heat are wasted (heaters, stoves, car engines, industrial
exhausts). Thermoelectric generators (TEGs) convert temperature DIFFERENCES into
electricity (Seebeck effect), but commercial TEGs are expensive. Can a DIY
thermoelectric setup using common metals (copper + iron/steel wire — a thermocouple)
be optimized to generate USEFUL amounts of electricity from household heat waste?
**Challenge:**
Determine the optimal junction geometry, number of series-connected thermocouples,
and temperature differential to generate enough power from a heater or stove to
charge a phone (5V, 500mA = 2.5W). Focus on maximizing the Seebeck coefficient
through wire gauge, junction treatment (acid etching? Oxidation?), and thermal
isolation between hot and cold sides.
**Home Test:** Build a copper-iron thermocouple array. Place hot side on heater/
stove, cold side in air/water. Measure voltage with multimeter. Iterate on
geometry to maximize power output.

### 4. Microwave-Induced Plasma for Material Synthesis
**Domain:** Plasma Physics / Chemistry
**Problem:**
Plasma (ionized gas) is used industrially for coating, sterilizing, and even
creating nanomaterials — but requires expensive vacuum chambers. A grape cut in
half in a microwave generates plasma due to electromagnetic field concentration.
**Challenge:**
Can this home microwave plasma be DIRECTED and CONTROLLED to do useful work?
Specifically: can microwave plasma be used to deposit thin carbon films (from
pencil graphite), reduce metal oxides (rust removal), or synthesize simple
nanostructures? Determine the geometry of objects that maximally concentrate the
microwave field to create stable, directional plasma at atmospheric pressure.
**Home Test:** Experiment with different shapes (pointed wires, split objects)
in a microwave to create controlled plasma. Test if items placed near the plasma
zone show surface changes (coat a glass slide, attempt rust removal on iron).
⚠️ SAFETY: Use a sacrificial microwave, ensure ventilation, never use metals
that could cause arcing damage.

### 5. Passive Radiative Cooling Below Ambient Temperature
**Domain:** Thermodynamics / Materials Science
**Problem:**
Air conditioning uses massive energy. But the sky is essentially a heat sink at
3K (-270°C). Certain surfaces can radiate heat through the atmospheric infrared
window (8-13 μm) FASTER than they absorb heat from surroundings, cooling below
ambient temperature even in sunlight — no electricity needed.
**Challenge:**
Design a DIY radiative cooling surface using HOUSEHOLD materials. Aluminum foil
(solar reflector) + specific paint/coating combinations (high IR emissivity in
8-13μm window). What is the optimal layered structure? White paint on aluminum?
Specific polymer films (plastic wrap types)? The goal: achieve measurable cooling
(even 2-5°C below ambient) that could reduce indoor temperatures for free.
**Home Test:** Create test panels with different coatings (white paint on foil,
plastic wrap layers on foil, bare foil). Place outdoors facing the sky. Measure
surface temperature vs. ambient with a thermometer. Compare day and night
performance.

### 6. Electromagnetic Seed Treatment for Enhanced Germination
**Domain:** Agricultural Biophysics
**Problem:**
Millions of small farmers struggle with poor germination rates. Research shows
that exposing seeds to specific electromagnetic fields BEFORE planting can
increase germination rate by 10-40% and accelerate early growth. The mechanism
(ion channel activation? Aquaporin stimulation?) is not fully understood.
**Challenge:**
Determine the OPTIMAL electromagnetic exposure for common crop seeds (beans,
corn, tomatoes). Variables: frequency (static magnet vs. alternating field from
copper coil), field strength (number of coil turns, current from batteries),
exposure time (minutes to hours). What is the underlying biophysical mechanism?
**Home Test:** Wind copper wire around a cardboard tube to make a coil. Connect
to battery/power supply. Place seeds inside for various durations. Plant treated
vs. untreated seeds and track germination rate and growth over 2-3 weeks.

### 7. Solar Water Desalination Efficiency Optimization
**Domain:** Thermodynamics / Environmental Engineering
**Problem:**
Solar stills (evaporate saltwater, condense freshwater) are ancient but inefficient
(~30-40% solar efficiency). Modern research shows that dark, porous materials
floating on the water surface can achieve 80%+ efficiency by localizing heat at
the evaporation interface instead of heating the bulk water.
**Challenge:**
Design an optimized solar still using ONLY household materials that maximizes
distillation rate. What is the best dark absorber (burnt cloth? Charcoal? Black
sponge)? What wick structure draws water to the hot surface fastest? How should
the condensation surface be angled and cooled? Target: produce drinkable water
from seawater/contaminated water at maximum rate per unit area.
**Home Test:** Build test stills using plastic containers, black fabric, plastic
wrap. Measure water output per hour. Compare bulk-heating vs. surface-heating
designs. Test with salt water — measure salt content of output.

### 8. DIY Electrochemical Water Splitting — Optimal Electrode Treatment
**Domain:** Electrochemistry / Energy
**Problem:**
Green hydrogen production via water electrolysis could replace fossil fuels, but
platinum catalysts make it expensive. Rust (iron oxide) and nickel (from old coins
or stainless steel) can catalyze water splitting, but efficiency varies hugely
based on surface preparation.
**Challenge:**
Find the optimal HOME treatment for iron/nickel/stainless steel electrodes that
maximizes hydrogen production rate per watt of input electricity. Variables:
surface roughening (sandpaper grit), thermal oxidation (oven treatment to create
specific oxide layer), electrochemical activation cycles, electrolyte concentration
(baking soda/KOH). Can a treated nail approach the performance of platinum?
**Home Test:** Electrolyze water (baking soda + water + 9V battery or USB power)
with different electrode treatments. Measure gas production rate by collecting
bubbles in an inverted container. Compare treated vs. untreated electrodes.

### 9. Thermal Mass Optimization for Passive Home Heating/Cooling
**Domain:** Thermodynamics / Architecture
**Problem:**
Heating and cooling buildings uses ~40% of global energy. Thermal mass (water
containers, concrete, phase-change materials) can store heat during the day and
release it at night, but optimal placement and material choice isn't well studied
for HOME-SCALE applications.
**Challenge:**
Determine the OPTIMAL thermal mass setup for a single room using common materials.
How many liters of water, at what position, in what container, with what insulation
arrangement, maximizes temperature stability? Can adding salt (changing specific
heat/freezing point) or using sealed containers of wax/coconut oil (phase change
at ~24°C) outperform water? Model the heat transfer and verify experimentally.
**Home Test:** Place water containers (jugs, bottles) in a room with a heater.
Measure room temperature cycling over 24 hours with vs. without thermal mass.
Test different positions, volumes, and materials (water, salt water, oil).

### 10. Copper Mesh EMF Shielding — Optimal Geometry for Health/Electronics
**Domain:** Electromagnetic Engineering
**Problem:**
EMF shielding (Faraday cages) blocks electromagnetic radiation but is usually
expensive. Copper mesh/screen can create effective shielding, but the relationship
between mesh hole size, wire thickness, and shielding at specific frequencies
(WiFi 2.4/5GHz, microwave 2.45GHz, cell 700MHz-2.5GHz) isn't well characterized
for HOME-MADE shields.
**Challenge:**
Determine the maximum mesh hole size (minimum copper used) that still blocks
>99% of specific frequencies. Can household copper wire (stripped electrical wire)
woven into a simple grid pattern on a frame be as effective as commercial shielding?
What is the optimal pattern — square grid, hexagonal, or random mesh? This enables
DIY shielding for sensitive electronics or EMF-concerned individuals at near-zero cost.
**Home Test:** Build mesh grids with different hole sizes from stripped copper wire.
Place phone inside, measure signal loss (signal bars, WiFi strength app). Test
microwave leakage with mesh over the door window. Map shielding vs. hole size.

### 11. Bio-Battery from Soil/Compost (Microbial Fuel Cell)
**Domain:** Bioelectrochemistry / Renewable Energy
**Problem:**
Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) generate electricity from bacteria decomposing organic
matter in soil — essentially a battery powered by dirt. Current designs produce
very low power (~0.5V, microamps). Scaling up could provide free electricity from
compost/waste in off-grid communities.
**Challenge:**
Optimize a soil-based microbial fuel cell for maximum power density using home
materials. Variables: electrode material (copper, carbon/graphite from pencils,
aluminum), soil type (compost vs. garden soil), moisture level, nutrient addition
(sugar, urine), electrode surface area and spacing. Can series/parallel combinations
of optimized cells produce enough power for an LED or sensor?
**Home Test:** Insert copper and graphite electrodes into wet soil/compost.
Measure voltage/current with multimeter. Test different soils, depths, and
nutrients. Connect multiple cells in series to light an LED.

### 12. Acoustic Levitation & Manipulation with DIY Ultrasonic Arrays
**Domain:** Acoustics / Physics
**Problem:**
Ultrasonic transducers (from cheap distance sensors ~$1 each) can create standing
waves that levitate small objects (foam beads, water drops). This is used in
contactless manufacturing and drug delivery research. The physics of optimal
array geometry for HOME-BUILT levitators isn't well explored.
**Challenge:**
Determine the minimum number of ultrasonic transducers and optimal arrangement
to reliably levitate and MOVE objects along a controlled path. Can a DIY array
made from cheap HC-SR04 sensor transducers, driven by an Arduino, manipulate
droplets of liquid for contactless mixing (poor-person's lab-on-chip)?
**Home Test:** Extract transducers from HC-SR04 sensors (~$1). Build a phased
array driven by Arduino. Map the acoustic field with a microphone. Attempt
levitation of styrofoam beads and water drops. Test object manipulation by
phase-shifting the drive signals.
