### 1. Chip Packet Solar Water Heater — Optimal Reflector Geometry
**Domain:** Solar Thermal Engineering / Optics
**Problem:**
Chip packets (Simba, Lays, etc.) have a metallized polymer inner layer that
reflects light almost as well as aluminum foil, but they're FREE — thrown away by
the thousands daily in Khayelitsha. Black plastic bags absorb solar radiation
efficiently. Combined with PET bottles or glass, these can create a solar water
heater at zero cost.
**Challenge:**
Design the OPTIMAL geometry for a chip-packet-lined parabolic trough or compound
parabolic concentrator (CPC) that focuses sunlight onto a black-painted pipe
carrying water. What is the ideal trough shape that can be formed from flattened
chip packets glued to cardboard? What concentration ratio is achievable? At
Cape Town's latitude (-34°), what tilt angle and orientation maximizes year-round
hot water production? Target: heat 20 liters to 60°C in under 2 hours using
ONLY waste materials. Calculate the expected thermal efficiency.
**Materials:** Chip packets, cardboard, black bags, PET bottles, old garden hose
or copper pipe, wire for structure.
**Impact:** Free hot water for bathing and cleaning — currently people burn
paraffin (expensive, causes fires/pollution) or use electric kettles on stolen
electricity connections (dangerous).

### 2. Plastic Waste Pyrolysis — Minimum Viable Fuel Reactor
**Domain:** Chemical Engineering / Thermochemistry
**Problem:**
Khayelitsha generates tons of plastic waste daily (LDPE bags, PET bottles, PP
containers, HDPE). Pyrolysis (heating plastic without oxygen at 300-500°C)
converts it back into liquid fuel oil that can be burned in lamps, stoves, or
even diesel generators. But current DIY designs are dangerous and inefficient.
**Challenge:**
Design the SAFEST, simplest pyrolysis reactor from household materials that
converts plastic waste into usable fuel oil. Key parameters: What is the minimum
temperature needed for each plastic type? How to create an oxygen-free chamber
from tin cans/old pots with clay seals? What condensation tube length and cooling
method maximizes liquid fuel recovery vs. gas loss? What is the energy balance —
does burning a small amount of output fuel produce enough heat to pyrolyze the
next batch (self-sustaining cycle)? What plastic types should be AVOIDED (PVC
releases toxic chlorine gas)?
**Materials:** Old metal pot with lid, copper or steel tubing for condenser, clay
for sealing, water bucket for cooling, fire/braai for heat source.
**Impact:** Turns worthless garbage into cooking/lighting fuel. A family could
produce 1-2 liters of fuel per day from neighborhood plastic waste. Also cleans
the environment.

### 3. DIY Copper Oxide Solar Cell — Maximizing Efficiency
**Domain:** Semiconductor Physics / Photovoltaics
**Problem:**
Cuprous oxide (Cu₂O) is a natural semiconductor. When you heat copper over a
flame until it's red-hot, then let it cool slowly, a layer of Cu₂O forms. This
layer generates electricity when exposed to sunlight — a solar cell made from
scrap copper. Current DIY versions produce tiny amounts (~0.01% efficiency), but
the theoretical limit for Cu₂O is ~20%. The gap is enormous.
**Challenge:**
Find the OPTIMAL oxidation protocol for scrap copper to maximize Cu₂O solar cell
efficiency using only home tools. Variables: heating temperature (gas stove vs.
braai coals — ~600-1000°C range), heating duration, cooling rate (air vs. water
quench vs. slow cool in sand), copper surface preparation (sanding grit, cleaning
with vinegar), electrolyte composition (salt water vs. baking soda solution).
What thickness of Cu₂O layer maximizes photon absorption while minimizing
series resistance? Can multiple cells connected in series charge a phone battery?
**Materials:** Scrap copper sheet/wire (from electrical cable), salt, water,
vinegar, sandpaper, stove/braai, glass jar, alligator clips.
**Impact:** If efficiency can reach even 1-2%, a ~1m² panel of treated copper
strips could generate meaningful phone-charging power for FREE from scrap wire.

### 4. Sand Thermal Battery — Solar Heat Storage for Night Cooking
**Domain:** Thermal Engineering / Energy Storage
**Problem:**
Cooking fuel (paraffin, gas, wood) costs R200-500/month per family in Khayelitsha.
The sun is free but only available during the day. Sand stores heat extremely well
(specific heat: 830 J/kg·K) and can reach 200-300°C in an insulated solar
concentrator. A well-insulated sand battery charged by the sun during the day
could provide cooking heat at night.
**Challenge:**
Design an insulated sand thermal battery that stores enough heat from a DIY solar
concentrator to cook a meal (bring 5L of water to boil) after sunset. Calculate:
how many kg of sand, at what temperature, with what insulation (found materials:
cardboard, crumpled chip packets as reflective insulation, dry grass, old clothing)?
What is the optimal container shape? How should heat be extracted — direct pot
contact or heat pipes? What solar concentrator design (chip-packet-lined satellite
dish from trash?) achieves the required sand temperature?
**Materials:** Sand (FREE — everywhere), old metal container/pot, chip packets for
insulation and solar reflector, cardboard, glass/plastic cover, old satellite dish.
**Impact:** Eliminates cooking fuel costs entirely. A family saves R3000+/year
and eliminates paraffin fire risk (paraffin fires kill hundreds in townships yearly).

### 5. Black Bag Thermosiphon — Zero-Pump Solar Hot Water System
**Domain:** Fluid Dynamics / Solar Thermal
**Problem:**
A thermosiphon uses natural convection (hot water rises) to circulate water
through a solar collector WITHOUT a pump — zero electricity needed. Commercial
systems cost R8000+. In Khayelitsha, black HDPE bags and black garden hose
are ubiquitous waste materials that absorb solar radiation efficiently.
**Challenge:**
Determine the OPTIMAL pipe diameter, collector area, tank height differential,
and insulation for a zero-cost thermosiphon system. What flow rate does natural
convection achieve with a 1m height difference and 40°C temperature differential?
How should the black absorber be arranged — coiled hose in a glazed box (PET
bottle greenhouse), or serpentine flat plate? What is the minimum collector area
to heat 50 liters to 55°C (hot shower temperature) by 3 PM in Cape Town winter
(June, ~4 kWh/m²/day, 10°C ambient)?
**Materials:** Black garden hose or black-painted copper pipe, plastic container
for tank, PET bottles or glass for glazing, brick/block for elevation, chip
packets for reflective backing.
**Impact:** Every household gets free hot showers. No electricity, no paraffin,
no fires. The system is permanent once built.

### 6. Atmospheric Water Harvesting — Fog/Dew Collector for Clean Water
**Domain:** Thermodynamics / Materials Science
**Problem:**
Cape Town's water is expensive and sometimes scarce (Day Zero crisis). Khayelitsha
has fog coming off False Bay and heavy dew most mornings. Mesh fog collectors and
radiative cooling dew condensers can harvest water from AIR at zero cost, but
efficiency depends critically on mesh geometry and surface properties.
**Challenge:**
Design an optimal water harvesting surface from waste materials. For fog
collection: what mesh density (made from cut-up shade cloth or onion bags)
maximizes water capture vs. wind resistance? For dew condensation: can a
chip-packet-lined sheet (high IR reflectivity on top, radiative cooling surface
underneath) cool below dew point at night to condense liters of water? What
surface coating maximizes water droplet formation and shedding (hydrophobic vs.
hydrophilic — wax vs. clean metal)? Target: harvest 2-5 liters per night per m².
**Materials:** Shade cloth/mesh bags, metal sheeting, chip packets, wire frame,
collection gutter from cut bottles, wax/cooking oil for coating.
**Impact:** Free clean water with zero energy input. Critical for drought
resilience and communities with unreliable municipal water.

### 7. Tin Can Solar Air Heater — Optimal Thermal Design
**Domain:** Solar Thermal Engineering / Heat Transfer
**Problem:**
Khayelitsha shacks are bitterly cold in winter (5-10°C). A solar air heater
made from tin cans painted black, arranged in columns inside a glazed frame,
can heat air by 20-40°C as it passes through — pumping free hot air into a
shack all day using only convection (no fan needed). But the optimal design
parameters aren't well established for tin can geometry.
**Challenge:**
Determine the OPTIMAL configuration: number of cans in series per column, number
of parallel columns, hole sizes between cans (controls airflow rate vs. heat
transfer time), glazing type (glass vs. plastic), inlet/outlet placement for
maximum natural convection airflow, and absorber coating (what type of black
paint/soot treatment has highest solar absorptance?). Calculate the expected
air temperature rise and heating power for a 1m² collector in Cape Town winter.
**Materials:** Used tin cans (beer/food), black paint or candle soot, wooden
frame or cardboard, glass from old window or clear plastic sheeting, screws/wire.
**Impact:** Free heating all winter. Replaces paraffin heaters that cost money,
pollute indoor air (respiratory disease), and cause fatal fires.

### 8. PET Bottle Biogas Digester — Cooking Gas from Food Waste
**Domain:** Biochemistry / Anaerobic Engineering
**Problem:**
Every household in Khayelitsha produces food waste (vegetable peels, leftovers).
Anaerobic digestion converts this into methane (biogas) that can be burned for
cooking — essentially free cooking gas from garbage. Small-scale digesters exist
but production rate optimization for WARM climates (Khayelitsha ~15-25°C average)
is under-studied.
**Challenge:**
Design the simplest possible biogas digester from PET bottles and containers that
produces enough methane to cook one meal per day for one family. What is the
optimal feedstock ratio (carbon:nitrogen ratio from mixing food waste with
grass/paper)? What container volume is minimum viable? How to maintain anaerobic
conditions with a simple water seal? What temperature optimization (black-painted
container in sun) increases gas production rate? How to safely store and regulate
gas pressure for a stove burner?
**Materials:** Large PET bottles or 20L containers, plastic tubing, water for
gas seal, inner tube rubber for gas storage bag, food waste, animal manure
(available from informal areas).
**Impact:** Free cooking fuel from waste that would otherwise rot and smell.
Residual slurry is excellent fertilizer for food gardens.

### 9. Seawater Battery — Low-Cost Energy Storage
**Domain:** Electrochemistry / Energy Storage
**Problem:**
Khayelitsha is ~10km from the ocean. Seawater is a free electrolyte. Combined
with scrap metals (aluminum from cans, copper from wire, zinc from old batteries,
carbon from pencils/charcoal), seawater batteries can store electricity at near-
zero cost. Current designs have poor energy density, but the chemistry hasn't been
optimized for PRACTICAL township use.
**Challenge:**
Find the OPTIMAL metal pair and cell design for a seawater battery maximizing
energy stored per rand spent. Test combinations: aluminum-copper, zinc-copper,
aluminum-carbon, zinc-carbon (from braai charcoal). What electrode surface
treatment (sanding, acid wash with vinegar, thermal oxidation) maximizes
capacity? What salt concentration is optimal? Can additives (vinegar, bicarbonate)
improve voltage or capacity? Target: a battery bank that costs <R20 in scrap
materials and can charge a phone (5V, 10Wh) or run an LED light for 8 hours.
**Materials:** Aluminum cans, copper wire, charcoal, salt/seawater, vinegar,
plastic containers for cells, wire for connections.
**Impact:** Free electricity storage. Charge from solar during day, use at night
for lighting and phone charging.

### 10. Evaporative Cooling Fridge — Zero-Electricity Food Preservation
**Domain:** Thermodynamics / Food Science
**Problem:**
Many Khayelitsha households don't have reliable refrigeration. Food spoils within
hours in summer heat (35°C+). The pot-in-pot cooler (Zeer pot) uses evaporative
cooling to reduce temperature by 10-20°C, but optimization for Cape Town's
specific humidity range (40-80%) isn't well studied. Also, the classic design
uses clay pots that aren't available — what WASTE MATERIALS work?
**Challenge:**
Design an evaporative cooler from waste materials that achieves the maximum
temperature drop in Cape Town's climate. Can a tin-can-in-tin-can design (with
wet sand between) match clay pot performance? What wicking material between the
layers (old cloth, sponge, shredded paper) maximizes evaporation rate? Does
adding salt or charcoal to the sand improve performance? What is the theoretical
minimum temperature achievable at 25°C/60% humidity? Can this reliably keep
milk/meat safe (<5°C) for 24+ hours?
**Materials:** Tin cans or plastic buckets (two sizes), sand, old cloth for
wicking, water, lid material.
**Impact:** Reduces food waste and food poisoning. Families can buy meat/dairy
in bulk when affordable without it spoiling. Also stores medicines that need
refrigeration (insulin, ARVs).

### 11. Plastic-Waste Construction Blocks — Structural Insulation
**Domain:** Materials Science / Structural Engineering
**Problem:**
Shacks in Khayelitsha are made from corrugated zinc — extremely cold in winter,
extremely hot in summer, and no insulation. Meanwhile, plastic waste is everywhere.
Melting/compressing plastic waste into building blocks creates free insulation AND
reduces waste, but the structural and thermal properties of different plastic
waste mixtures haven't been optimized.
**Challenge:**
Determine the OPTIMAL plastic-waste-to-sand ratio, heating temperature, and
compression method to create building blocks with maximum insulation value AND
adequate structural strength. Which plastics melt at safe temperatures (LDPE bags
~120°C, PP ~160°C) vs dangerous ones (PVC — toxic, avoid)? Does adding sand
(for compressive strength) or shredded cloth (for tensile strength) improve the
blocks? What thickness provides R-value equivalent to standard building insulation?
Can blocks be made in a simple tin mold heated over a braai?
**Materials:** Plastic bags, chip packets, sand, old molds/tins, braai fire.
**Impact:** Free insulation panels that could be mounted inside zinc shacks.
Transforms waste into warm, comfortable homes. Could reduce winter cold exposure
deaths.

### 12. Solar-Powered Phone Charger from Car Battery Scrap
**Domain:** Electrical Engineering / Photovoltaics
**Problem:**
Phone charging costs R5-10 per charge at spaza shops. Scrap car batteries contain
lead plates and sulfuric acid. Old solar garden lights contain small solar cells.
Salvaged car alternators contain copper windings. Can these waste components be
combined into a free community phone charging station?
**Challenge:**
Design the optimal circuit to charge phones from salvaged solar cells and store
energy in reconditioned lead-acid cells. How to recondition a dead car battery
(desulfation via controlled overcharging)? What voltage regulation circuit can be
built from salvaged components to safely provide 5V USB output? How many small
solar cells (from garden lights, ~0.5V, 100mA each) must be combined, and what
series/parallel configuration is optimal? Can the copper from a single car
alternator be rewound into a charge controller inductor?
**Materials:** Dead car batteries, broken solar garden lights, scrap wire, old USB
cables, salvaged electronic components.
**Impact:** Free phone charging = access to mobile banking (essential for economic
participation in SA), emergency calls, education, job searching.

### 13. Solar Concentrator Cooking — Satellite Dish Conversion
**Domain:** Solar Thermal / Optics
**Problem:**
Old satellite dishes (DSTV) are discarded all over Khayelitsha. Lined with
reflective material (chip packets, aluminum foil), they become powerful solar
concentrators that can focus enough energy to boil water or cook food. But the
DSTV dish parabola geometry wasn't designed for solar — its focal point and
concentration ratio need to be characterized and optimized.
**Challenge:**
Calculate the focal point and achievable temperature for a standard 60cm and 90cm
DSTV dish lined with chip packets. What is the reflectivity of chip packet
metallization vs. pure aluminum? Does crumpling/flattening affect specular vs.
diffuse reflection? What pot support geometry places the cooking vessel at exactly
the focal point? Can a modified dish achieve 300°C+ for actual frying/baking,
not just boiling? What tracking mechanism (manual repositioning schedule) is needed
for a 2-hour cooking session? Is a flat Fresnel reflector (angled flat strips of
chip packets) more practical than a dish?
**Materials:** Old DSTV dish, chip packets, glue, wire for pot stand, black pot.
**Impact:** Completely free cooking during daytime. Zero fuel cost. Combined with
the sand thermal battery (Problem #4), provides 24-hour free cooking.

### 14. Greywater Heat Recovery — Capturing Waste Hot Water Energy
**Domain:** Heat Transfer / Environmental Engineering
**Problem:**
When people DO heat water (for tea, cooking, bathing), the warm greywater goes
straight down the drain, wasting all that thermal energy. A simple heat exchanger
could pre-heat incoming cold water using outgoing warm water, cutting heating
energy needs by 30-60%. This technology exists for wealthy homes but has never
been designed for informal settlement conditions.
**Challenge:**
Design the simplest possible heat exchanger from scrap copper pipe or garden hose
that recovers heat from greywater. What is the optimal tube-in-tube or coil
geometry for maximum heat transfer with minimum pressure drop (no pump available)?
How much copper pipe (from scrap electrical cable) is needed to achieve 50% heat
recovery from a 40°C, 20-liter batch of wash water? The recovered heat pre-warms
the next batch, creating a compounding efficiency gain.
**Materials:** Scrap copper pipe/tubing, garden hose, bucket, basic fittings.
**Impact:** Every family that heats water saves 30-50% of their heating fuel/
electricity. Across 100,000+ households, this is massive cumulative impact.

### 15. Wind Turbine from Scrap — Car Alternator Conversion
**Domain:** Electrical Engineering / Aerodynamics
**Problem:**
Cape Town's Cape Flats (where Khayelitsha sits) gets strong, consistent south-
easterly winds (the "Cape Doctor"), especially in summer. Scrap car alternators
are readily available from junkyards (R50-100). Combined with PVC pipe or tin can
blades, this can become a wind turbine. But standard car alternators need high RPM
(~1000+) while wind turbines spin slowly (~200-400 RPM).
**Challenge:**
How to modify a car alternator for low-RPM power generation? Options: rewinding
the stator with more turns of thinner wire (increases voltage per RPM), adding
stronger magnets (neodymium from old hard drives), or using a gear/belt drive
from scrap. What blade design (number, pitch, chord) from PVC pipe or tin sheet
maximizes power extraction at typical Cape Town wind speeds (15-30 km/h)? What
is the theoretical maximum power for a 1m diameter rotor at these speeds (Betz
limit)? Can the output charge a car battery for overnight LED lighting?
**Materials:** Scrap car alternator, PVC pipe or tin sheet for blades, old hard
drive magnets, car battery, wire, pole/mast.
**Impact:** Free wind electricity — particularly valuable because Cape Town wind
is strongest in summer when days are longest, and solar + wind together provide
near-24-hour renewable coverage.
